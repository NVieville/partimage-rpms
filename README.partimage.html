<h3>SystemRescueCd and Partimage</h3>
<p> <a href="http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page">System Rescue CD</a> 
is a live distribution with several tools for repairing file systems. 
It can be used through a <a href="http://www.sysresccd.org/Online-Manual-EN">CD-Rom</a>,
a pen-drive, or a floppy. 
In the case of a pendrive,
boot from a USB device must be <b>on</b> in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">BIOS</a>. Furthermore, in some mobos,
it is necessary to access the BIOS with the pendrive plugged in, select the tab <b>Boot ->
Hard Disk Drives</b>, and set the pendrive to be the <b>1st drive</b>. In any case,
the pendrive must be made <a href="http://linux.web.psi.ch/livecd/usbdisk.html">bootable</a>.
</p><p>
During the boot, SystemRescueCd detects the hardware and allows the choice of
the keyboard type. If the computer is on a network, just type <br>
<b>net-setup eth0</b> from the command-line,
and configure the network.
<p></p>
For creating partitions, <b>run_qtparted</b> used to start 
<a href="http://qtparted.sourceforge.net/">QtParted</a>.
Newer versions, however, are shipping <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net">gparted</a>, instead. 
In this case, <b>xinit</b> has to be run before calling gparted, because
it only works in graphical mode.
It is possible then to delete, create, or format partitions. It is never too much
to remind people to <u>backup</u> important data before any attempt to modify partitions.
There is always the risk of messing the 
<a href="http://ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.html">partition table</a>, 
although, in general, this does not happen.
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.partimage.org/Partimage-manual">Partimage</a>
can be used for backing up a partition, and its usage is straightforward. 
Just highlight the partition to be saved, choose a name for its backup,
and optionally another machine on the network, running a partimage server,
to receive the image. In the server, the file <b>/etc/sysconfig/partimaged</b>
should contain options like this:
</p><p>
OPTIONS="--port=4025 --dest /your_image_dir/images"
</p><p>
The client must always be run as <b>root</b>, and it can optionally use a password
for accessing the server. 
However, the client must have been compiled with "login" enabled, in this case. 
In fact, the client compilation options, and the server options, must match,
e.g., ssl and login. Otherwise, a "version mismatch" error occurs. 

Should your client use "login", the users allowed to connect to the server must
be listed in the file <b>/etc/partimaged/partimagedusers</b>, one per line.
If, besides using login, pam support is also enabled, the authentication
is done based on a db4 database created by the script 
<b>/usr/share/partimaged/partimaged-passwd</b>. The database entries
are pairs of (user,password). Please, read <b>man partimaged-passwd</b> for
getting all the options on how to add/delete users from the database.

</p><p>
For using the ssl capability, the certificates have to be created by running
<b>/usr/share/partimaged/create_certificates.sh</b>. The file 
<b>/etc/partimaged/partimage-certs.cnf</b> can be customized, in order to change
information, such as, Country, State and Location.
Clients supplied with SystemRescueCd, version 1.3.1 or greater, ARE compiled with 
ssl and login enabled. Therefore, the partimage package was created with the same 
options also enabled.
Please, note that, for disabling ssl in the server, it is enough to add 
the option <b>--nossl</b> to its configuration file, and <u>restart</u> the server.
To check which compilation options have been chosen, just type <b>partimaged -i</b>.

</p><p>
Another point is that the client and server architectures must be the same.
Therefore, if you use a CD with a 32 bit client, the server must be 
a 32 bit version too, even if it is running on a 64 bit platform. 

</p><p>
The backup files should be named using mnemonics easy to remember, such as,
boot-hostname-Fx or root-hostname-Fx. There is also an option to break
the image in parts, so they fit on a CD. Generally, 690MB is a good choice, 
which will produce root-hostname-Fx.000, root-hostname-Fx.001, etc...
If you do not want to save the image on another computer, 
then just mount another partition on the same computer to receive the image.
</p><p>
To restore a backup, just do the reverse, highlight the partition to be restored, 
and type the name of the first file of the backup: <b>root-hostname-Fx.000</b>.
<p></p>
Remember that the size of the partition to be restored must be 
<u>greater or equal</u> than the size of the saved partition. 
If it is greater, then the corresponding file system
should be enlarged to occupy all of the available space. For an 
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-ext3.html">ext3</a>
file system, use:
<p></p>
<b>e2fsck</b> -f /dev/sdan <br>
<b>resize2fs</b> -f /dev/sdan  
<p></p>
The enlargement of the size of the file system can be done at any time later, 
and it is not mandatory (but the excess is lost, otherwise).
