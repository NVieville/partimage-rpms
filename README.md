# partimage-rpms

Partimage repository to build RPM packages for Fedora.
Contains all the files needed to build RPMS/SRPMS and depends on https://github.com/NVieville/partimage/tree/0.6.10_beta1 for the patched sources files from last available ones from https://sourceforge.net/p/partimage/code/ci/master/tree/.

The purpose of this repository is to be able to build the partimage-server package for the last Fedora distribution, in order to support image files of old machines cloned across network with old partimage client hosted on new servers.

No support will be provided through this repository and it is only made available as is.
